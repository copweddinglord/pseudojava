# Unified Computation Framework

A framework combining fuzzy logic, 11-dimensional computation, memory management, and efficient data processing.

## Overview

This framework provides a set of header files that implement various computational paradigms:

- **Memory Systems**: Probability cloud-based memory management with living number generation
- **TickStack**: 11-dimensional data structures and electron-free literal operations
- **Higgs Field**: Simulation with routing affinity and fuzzy logic prioritization
- **Mirror King**: Adaptive whitelist generation through pattern reflection
- **O_wisdom**: Big O complexity analysis and visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C compiler supporting C99 standard
- Make (for building examples)

### Building Examples

```bash
make examples
